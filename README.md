# Installation

Extract the contents of the plugin in your "wordpress/wp-content/plugins/" directory

The four Micro-blog Tools plugins components should now appear in your list of plugins:

* Micro-blog Tools
* Micro-blog Tools - Bit.ly URLs 
* Micro-blog Tools - Exclude Category 
* Micro-blog Tools - Hashtags

The only one you _need_ to activate is the first one: "Micro-blog Tools".  
The others are optional and act like add-ons.

# Connecting to your micro-blog

After activating the Micro-blog Tools plugin, you need to connect it to your micro-blog.  
To do that, you can use the new menu item called "Micro-blog Tools settings" under "Settings" in your left navigation.

On the "Connect" page, first select your micro-blog provider (Twitter, Identi.ca or StatusNet)

## Twitter and Identi.ca

1. After clicking the "Connect" button, you will be redirected to your micro-blog provider.  
1. Log in if necessary
1. Simply click "Allow" to connect Micro-blog Tools to your micro-blog.  

## StatusNet

1. Enter the domain name of your StatusNet provider (ex: http://chimo.status.net/)
1. Click on the link that was generated from the domain you entered above.  
1. In the new window, log in if necessary.
1. You should now have a "New application" form that's already filled out.
1. Change "Default Access" (last option) to "Read-write"
1. Click "Save"
1. On the next page, click on the "Micro-blog Tools" link
1. Copy and paste the "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret" values in the Micro-blog Tools boxes

You will then be redirected here where you\'ll be able to change your settings, if desired.
